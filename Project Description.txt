This project uses JavaFX to implement a 'Guess the word' type of game.
Implemented actions:
1. read words from a file, puts them in a list and chooses a random word from the list
2. the user can test different letters to check if they match
3. keep track of number of mistakes made
4. after guessing the word or using all available lives, the user can restart the game with a new word
